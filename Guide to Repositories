Welcome to my GitHub Site.  This site hosts a few repositories that I've created in the progress of my career.  
1. C++ Code Samples was from my Operating Systems class as an Undergraduate at URI. 
2. PharmacyOutreach was my internship project as an undergraduate creating a new rdbms for the URI Pharmacy Outreach Group
3. Planet War is a project I started during my Covid job search to develop my full stack skills. 
4. Technical writing, Documentation, Designs and PowerPoint Presentations because I'm creative and weird enough to enjoy such things.
